Universal functions in Numpy are simple mathematical functions. It is just a term that we gave to mathematical functions in the Numpy library. Numpy provides various universal functions that cover a wide variety of operations.

These functions include standard trigonometric functions, functions for arithmetic operations, handling complex numbers, statistical functions, etc.
Ex- sin, cos, tan,arcsin, arccos, arctan,hypot etc.

In the Python NumPy module, we have many aggregate functions or statistical functions to work with a single-dimensional or multi-dimensional array. The Python Numpy aggregate functions are sum, min, max, mean, average, product, median, standard deviation, variance, argmin, argmax, percentile, cumprod, cumsum, and corrcoef.

Aggregate functions which are used to perform some statistical data analysis

import numpy as np
a = np.array([10, 20, 30])
np.median(a)

Output:
20.0

ufuncs stands for "Universal Functions" and they are NumPy functions that operates on the ndarray object.

ufuncs are used to implement vectorization in NumPy which is way faster than iterating over elements.

import numpy as np

x = [1, 2, 3, 4]
y = [4, 5, 6, 7]
z = np.add(x, y)

Output:
[5 7 9 11]
